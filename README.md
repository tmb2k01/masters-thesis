# Master's Thesis â€“ Multi-Output Classification with Clustered Conformal Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and experimental framework for my master's thesis on **Implementation of Multi-Output Classification with Clustered Conformal Prediction**, aiming to enhance the reliability of structured prediction tasks. The focus is on quantifying uncertainty in predictions using conformal methods, particularly in the presence of output dependencies, and evaluating their effectiveness through reproducible experiments.

The project addresses the following key areas:

- **Multi-output classification**: Tackling problems where each input is associated with multiple interdependent labels.
- **Clustered conformal prediction**: Improving prediction sets by accounting for structure within output spaces.

## Documentation

For detailed information about specific components, refer to the following documentation:

- [Model Definition](doc/model-definition.md): Architecture and implementation details of the models.
- [Conformal Prediction](doc/conformal-prediction.md): Overview of the conformal prediction methodology.
- [Metrics](doc/metrics.md): Evaluation metrics and performance analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmb2k01/masters-thesis.git
cd masters-thesis
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Prepare the datasets:

```bash
bash scripts/prepare-data.sh
```

### Usage

#### Training Models

To train the models, run:

```bash
python3 -m src.main --train
```

This will start the training process.

#### Starting the Web Service

To start the web interface for making predictions:

```bash
python3 -m src.main
```

The web service will be available at `http://localhost:7860` by default and using the configurations specified in `static/config.json`.
